# Neural_Nets_from_Scratch
Implementation of various neural networks architectures in various coding languages following various programming paradigms.


## 1. A (Pseudo-)Functional Programming approach in Python for a Multilayer Perceptron
Let's start simple. Although somewhat outdated, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) is the most straightforward neural network architecture. Moreover, Python, with its numerical linear algebra library Numpy, arguably the most prominent, is a good starting point as a coding language. To eschew the overcomplication of issues related to class definitions, the code will work in a pseudo-functional fashion.
